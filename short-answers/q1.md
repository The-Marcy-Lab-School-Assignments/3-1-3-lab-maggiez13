# Question

What is the primary difference between an HTTP GET request and an HTTP Post request?

# Answer
A HTTP GET request retrieves data from the server and sends parameters via the URL, making the data visible. 

In contrast, a HTTP POST request sends data to the server to create or update resources, placing parameters in the request body, which allows for larger data payloads and keeps the data hidden from the URL.
