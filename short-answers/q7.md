# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer
1.  Modules provide scoped variables, reducing global namespace pollution and avoiding naming conflicts. They also support import and export statements, allowing for better code modularity and reusability.

2. Module scripts are deferred by default, ensuring they run only after the HTML document is fully parsed, and they always execute in strict mode, enhancing code quality and security.
