# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
The "Request/Response Cycle" in HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) involves a client sending a request to a server for a specific resource. 

The server processes this request and sends back a response containing the requested data, including a status code and a message body. 

This cycle forms the basis of communication between clients (like web browsers) and servers on the internet, enabling retrieval and interaction with information across the web. 

Key components of this interaction include the request URL, the action verb (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), the response status code, and the response body.
