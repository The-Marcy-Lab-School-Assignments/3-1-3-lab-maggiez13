# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer
The "Request/Response Cycle" in HTTP involves a client sending a request to a server for a specific resource. The server processes this request and sends back a response containing the requested data. This cycle forms the basis of communication between clients (like web browsers) and servers on the Internet, enabling retrieval and interaction with information across the web.
