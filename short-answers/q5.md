# Question

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information *directly* into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer
Inserting user-entered information directly into the DOM without escaping can lead to significant security risks, primarily Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. 

These attacks occur when malicious scripts are injected into web pages, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, site defacement, malware distribution, and phishing. 

XSS can severely damage user trust and the reputation of the affected organization. 

To prevent these risks, always escape user input before inserting it into the DOM using methods like `textContent`.
