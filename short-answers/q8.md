# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
Using semantic elements means employing HTML tags that clearly describe their content and purpose, enhancing accessibility, SEO, and code readability. 

Semantic elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>` provide meaningful context, unlike non-semantic elements like `<div>` and `<span>`, which do not convey content significance. 

For example, a `<section>` tag is more descriptive than a `<div>` when defining a document section. 

This practice helps browsers, search engines, and developers better understand and process the content.
