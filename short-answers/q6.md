# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer
`element.append()` is a versatile JavaScript method that allows you to append multiple nodes and text strings as the last child of a specified parent element. 

Unlike `element.appendChild()`, which only appends single nodes and throws an error when appending strings, `element.append()` accepts multiple arguments and can directly append text strings. 

This flexibility makes `element.append()` more convenient and efficient for appending various types of content in a single call.
